    \page meoutformat MotionEngine Output Format

    When the user requests motion from a Freespace device using a
    Data Mode Control V2 Request, the user must provide a Format by setting the
    formatSelect field and then request data fields by setting the appropriate Format
    Flags. The Format determines the different data fields that can be
    transmitted, and the Format Flags determine which fields are actually
    transmitted in the MotionEngine Output Packet. The MotionEngine Output Packets
    that are transmitted in response to a Data Mode Control V2 Request will have
    the same formatSelect and Format Flag values as the Request, plus the appropriate
    real-time data. Below is a table which outlines the available data fields by
    Format and Format Flag:

    | Format Flag | formatSelect = 0                | formatSelect = 1                               | formatSelect = 2 | formatSelect = 3                |

    | FF1         | Linear Acceleration             | Linear Acceleration, No Gravity                | Reserved         | Linear Acceleration             |
